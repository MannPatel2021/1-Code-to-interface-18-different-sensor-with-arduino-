--->Introduction
  This project demonstrates how to interface with 18 different sensors using a single codebase on an Arduino. Each sensor has its own specific implementation within the code, allowing you to read data from multiple sensors seamlessly.

--->Hardware Requirements:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)

--->The following sensors:

LED Blink
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
IR Sensor
PIR Sensor
MPU6050 Gyro and Acceleration Sensor
LM35 Temperature Sensor
HMC5883L Magnetometer Sensor
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Soil Moisture Sensor
BMP180 Barometer Sensor
MQ135 Air Quality Sensor
MQ2 Smoke Detection Sensor
MQ3 Alcohol Detection Sensor
LM393 LDR Sensor
LM393 Sound Detection Sensor
Flame Detection Sensor
Water Level Sensor
Hall Sensor
Software Requirements

Arduino IDE (version 1.8.13 or later)
Required libraries for each sensor (details provided below)
Installation

--->Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MannPatel2021/1-Code-to-interface-18-different-sensor-with-arduino-.git
cd sensor-interface-project
Open the project in Arduino IDE:

--->Launch the Arduino IDE.
  Open the sensor_interface.ino file from the cloned repository.
  
--->Install required libraries:
  Use the Arduino Library Manager to install the following libraries:
  Adafruit MPU6050
  Adafruit Unified Sensor
  Adafruit BMP085 Unified
  DHT sensor library
  Adafruit Sensor
  Other libraries as specified in the code comments for each sensor usage

--->Connect the sensors:
  Follow the wiring instructions provided in the code comments for each sensor.
  Ensure that all sensors are properly connected to the Arduino board.

--->Upload the code:
  Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE.
  Click on the Upload button to upload the code to the Arduino board.

--->Monitor sensor data:
  Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
  Set the baud rate to 9600.
  You should see the sensor data being printed in the Serial Monitor.
